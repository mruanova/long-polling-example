# long-polling-example

Hereâ€™s an example of how long polling can be implemented using a simple server and client setup with Node.js and JavaScript.

The server will hold the request open until it has new data to send, and the client will keep polling by making new requests after each response.

`npm init -y`
`npm install express`
`npm install ejs`
`node server.js`
